description: Inspect protein expression matrices with SDRF metadata, select traceable Mokume normalization, imputation, and differential-expression candidates, and evaluate those candidates through the bundled Mokume MCP server. Use for proteomics method selection, spike-in benchmarking, DEA configuration, dataset diagnostics, or explaining why Mokume can or cannot recommend a preset.

# Analyze Proteomics

Use the bundled `mokume` MCP tools for data access and computation. Keep biological
reasoning in the host model; never request or store a model API key inside Mokume.
If either public MCP tool is unavailable, stop and report a host/plugin integration
error. Do not replace the MCP workflow with a hand-written stdio client or a
different Mokume CLI path.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the protein matrix, SDRF, available peptide-count sidecar, optional
   ground-truth list, and output directory to absolute paths. Identify the
   contrast, explicit matrix scale (`linear` or `log2`), data type (`LFQ`, `DIA`,
   or `TMT`), upstream quantification, and upstream engine when known. Ask for the
   scale when it is unknown and ask for the data type when generic sample names do
   not identify it; do not infer either fact from intensity magnitude or sample
   count.
2. Call `mokume.inspect_dataset` before recommending or running anything. Put
   the explicit `input_scale` and optional `peptide_counts` path at the tool's
   top level. Put declared acquisition facts and any SDRF factor override in its
   `metadata` object. Treat the keys returned in
   `profile.samples_per_condition` as the canonical condition labels for
   subsequent contrasts.
3. Read every returned diagnostic. If policy disallows generation because the data
   type is `unknown`, ask for a supported declaration and inspect again. For any
   other policy error, report the abstention and do not manufacture a configuration.
4. Start from `policy_recommendation`. Change its `configs` only when the returned
   profile or evidence supports the change. Preserve the exact block contract in
   [recommendation-contract.md](references/recommendation-contract.md). Without a
   peptide-count sidecar, do not add `deqms` or an ensemble containing `deqms`;
   deterministic policy omits those candidates.
5. Call `mokume.evaluate_recommendation` with exactly two canonical condition
   labels returned by inspection. Do not substitute longer raw SDRF values when
   inspection normalized them. Put a new absolute `output_dir` and all runtime
   settings in its `options` object. Include the same peptide-count sidecar path,
   input scale, declared acquisition metadata, and factor override used during
   inspection in that object. The sidecar is mandatory when any candidate uses
   `deqms` directly or through an ensemble; evaluation rejects the whole round
   when it is absent. Keep `threads=24` unless the user explicitly chooses another
   value.
6. Compare results. With ground truth, use the returned Score A ranking. Without
   ground truth, inspect `method_sensitivity.tsv` and report shared versus
   method-sensitive signed calls without selecting or implying a winner. For a
   Score A ranking, report each candidate's tested universe (`TP + FP + FN + TN`);
   if those totals differ, qualify the ranking as candidate-universe-specific.
7. Report the knowledge fingerprint, evidence references, confidence, limitations,
   input scale, output paths, and whether the result is ranked or exploratory.

## Scientific Boundaries

- Treat quantification as frozen metadata at the protein-matrix entry point. Do not
  claim that this workflow re-ran MaxLFQ, DirectLFQ, piBAQ, or another aggregator.
- Never rank configurations from DE count, CV, missingness, method agreement, or
  permutation diagnostics.
- Interpret `missing_rate` as a fraction and CV values as unitless ratios. For
  example, `median_cv=0.0852` means a median CV of about `8.52%`, not `0.0852%`.
- Do not call a benchmark candidate optimal for the current dataset before it is
  evaluated with relevant ground truth.
- Keep FDR threshold as a user-controlled operating point; do not hide a changed
  threshold inside a candidate recommendation.
- Never use `input_scale=auto`; evaluation requires an explicit `linear` or
  `log2` declaration.
- Preserve evidence IDs and required limitations verbatim. Do not cite knowledge
  records outside the `allowed_evidence_refs` returned by `inspect_dataset`.
- Treat an inferred data type, unknown quantification, incompatible upstream engine,
  provisional preset, or weak held-out transfer as a material limitation.

## Iteration

Evaluate at most five candidates per round. On later rounds, change no more than two
executable axes per candidate and explain each change using the previous result and
allowed evidence. Stop when the user-requested budget is exhausted, policy abstains,
or further candidates would only repeat an existing executable signature.
