"""Vendor the shared Python sidecar subset from ``python/mokume`` into ``rust/python/mokume``.

``rust/python/mokume`` is a hand-maintained VENDORED COPY of a SUBSET of the
canonical ``python/mokume`` package: the plotting / QC / analysis / tissue-atlas
periphery that the Rust compute kernel does not port. ``python/mokume`` is the
canonical, upstream-facing source; the sidecar rides along inside the ``mokume-rs``
wheel so the periphery ships next to the compiled kernel.

Most of that subset is meant to be byte-for-byte identical to its canonical
counterpart. Keeping those files in sync by hand is drift-prone, so this script
copies the identical shared files from ``python/mokume`` into ``rust/python/mokume``
driven by the EXPLICIT ``SHARED_FILES`` allow-list below. A companion CI guard
(``.github/workflows/sidecar-drift.yml``) runs this script in ``--check`` mode and
fails if any allow-listed file has drifted between the two trees.

Modes
-----
- default (apply): copy every allow-listed file from ``python/mokume`` over the
  sidecar copy, so developers can re-sync after editing an upstream file.
- ``--check``: do not write anything; report any allow-listed file that differs
  (or is missing on either side) and exit non-zero. Used by CI.

The allow-list is DELIBERATELY explicit rather than "copy the whole tree": some
sidecar files INTENTIONALLY DIVERGE from canonical and must never be clobbered.
Those are catalogued in ``INTENTIONALLY_EXCLUDED`` (with the reason each one
diverges) purely as living documentation; the script simply never touches any
file that is not in ``SHARED_FILES``.

Intentionally-excluded (divergent) files — NOT vendored, do NOT add to the
allow-list:

  __init__.py
      Rust-wheel package init: imports the compiled ``mokume._mokume`` extension
      (``run`` / ``version``) and builds keyword->CLI-flag wrappers. A different
      public surface from the pure-Python package init.
  commands/__init__.py
      Documents/exposes the periphery commands as ``python -m mokume.commands.*``
      ``main(argv)`` modules instead of the pure-Python Click entrypoints.
  commands/visualize.py
  commands/tissuemap.py
      Re-architected from Click decorators to standalone ``argparse`` +
      ``main(argv) -> int`` to match the wheel's CLI-dispatch model. Same compute,
      different entrypoint wiring.
  core/__init__.py
      Lazy ``__getattr__`` for ``WriteCSVTask`` / ``WriteParquetTask`` so importing
      ``mokume.core`` does not require pyarrow.
  io/__init__.py
  normalization/__init__.py
  quantification/__init__.py
      Trimmed package inits: only the surviving vendored submodules are re-exported
      (FASTA / IRS / iBAQ respectively), via lazy ``__getattr__``; the Rust-ported
      methods and non-vendored submodules are dropped on purpose.
  io/fasta.py
  imputation/censored.py
  imputation/methods.py
  imputation/missforest.py
      Eager top-level ``pyopenms`` / ``scikit-learn`` imports with the optional-
      dependency ``try/except ImportError`` guards removed (the wheel bundles those
      deps as hard requirements). Same computation; only the import ceremony
      differs.

Sidecar-only files (exist ONLY in ``rust/python/mokume`` — no canonical
counterpart, so never synced): ``__main__.py``, ``commands/de_plots.py``,
``commands/interactive_report.py``, ``commands/peptides2protein_ibaq.py``,
``commands/peptides2protein_qc.py``.
